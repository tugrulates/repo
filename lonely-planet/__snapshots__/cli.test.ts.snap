And the contrasts aren't confined to building stock: Den Haag has a sophisticated urban charm, enchanting visitors with its art, fine dining and cultural scene; Zeeland has a dramatic back-of-beyond feel, with a sparsely populated and windswept landscape; and Gouda plays to every Dutch stereotype, with wheels of its famous yellow cheese and traditionally garbed locals ever-present.

Their central sections have distinctive double-level sides inset with what were once medieval warehouses – many now forming fascinating venues to eat, drink, dance or sleep, with terrace-walkways that extend right to the waterside. The brilliant cafe culture goes well beyond the canals – Utrecht's vibrant concert schedules are a big draw and, if the budget stretches, it's worth luxuriating in one of numerous historic mansions that have been turned into indulgent boutique hotels.","featuredImage":{"height":2952,"name":"57386144.jpg","title":"57386144.jpg","url":"https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/57386144.jpg","width":4428},"id":"150766","internalRanking":2.39132,"slug":"the-netherlands/the-randstad/utrecht-city","title":"Utrecht","type":"City"}
