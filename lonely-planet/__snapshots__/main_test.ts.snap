But Eindhoven is also a vibrant centre for creative design and post-industrial reinvention. OK, so visually the townscape has all the charm of Minsk on a bad hair day, but before rushing on, do at least consider visiting the fascinating Philips Museum, which tells the story of the global electronics company that essentially created modern Eindhoven. There's also a highly thought-provoking modern-art gallery and a UFO-shaped quirk of 1960s architecture.","featuredImage":{"alt":"Waterfront buildings at Eindhoven city in the Netherlands.","caption":"Waterfront buildings at Eindhoven city in the Netherlands.","credit":"©Juan Monte/EyeEm/Getty Images","height":3994,"name":"Panoramic View Of City Against Sky","title":"Panoramic View Of City Against Sky","url":"https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-02/GettyRF_742338977.jpg","width":6000},"id":"24596","internalRanking":0.7993,"slug":"the-netherlands/eindhoven","title":"Eindhoven","type":"City"}\`,
